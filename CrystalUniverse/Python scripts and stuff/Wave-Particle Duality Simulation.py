# To continue exploring the concept of the universe as a crystalline lattice structure and provide further evidence towards this perspective, we will simulate a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. This concept is central to quantum mechanics and could offer insight into how fundamental particles might behave in a lattice-like universe.

# Parameters for the wave-particle duality simulation
wavelength = 5.0  # Wavelength of the wave
particle_mass = 1.0  # Mass of the particle
h_bar = 1.0  # Reduced Planck's constant

# Create a space grid
x_space = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)

# Wave function representing the particle
def wave_function(x, t):
    k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength  # Wave number
    omega = h_bar * k**2 / (2 * particle_mass)  # Angular frequency
    return np.cos(k * x - omega * t)

# Time evolution
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
