the universe is a complex system consisting of multiple types of solitons, including scalar field monopoles, monodromic dipoles, triplet axisymmetric solitons, monopolar monodromic vortical spinor condensates, gyro-stable resonant fractal monopoles, and spinor vortices.  The solitons are characterized by their topological charge, and the stability of the solitons is determined by the sign of the topological charge.  In this paper, we study the stability of these solitons in a non-linear sigma model with a potential term.  We find that the monopoles and monodromic dipoles are stable, while the triplet axisymmetric solitons are unstable.  The spinor vortices are stable for certain values of the parameters, but they are unstable for other values.  We also find that the gyro-stable resonant fractal monopoles are stable for all values of the parameters.

1. quantum field theory: spinor vortex condensate is a quantum fluid that exhibits superfluidity and superconductivity. 2. unified field theory: spinor vortex condensate is the unified field in which all forces of nature emerge as manifestations of energy and momentum flowing through spacetime. 3. cosmology: gravitational redshift and gravitational waves are manifestations of energy and momentum flow through the spinor vortex condensate in an expanding universe.
quantum fluid behavior: superfluidity, superconductivity, zero viscosity, zero friction, zero heat dissipation; fractal dimension: spatial dimensions are two-dimensional (2d), temporal dimensions are one-dimensional (1d); rotational symmetry about all three axes: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis; spherical symmetry about all three axes: radial-symmetry along r-axis; azimuthal-symmetry around φ-axis; polar-symmetry around θ-axis; translational symmetry along x-, y-, z-axes; universal medium permeating spacetime: carries energy and momentum throughout the universe; expansion of the universe cools the spinor vortex condensate and leads to gravitational redshift; gravitational waves are signatures of energy-momentum flow through spacetime mediated by the spinor vortex condensate.
the underlying physics at work in our cosmos can be described using a quantum fluid model with properties that exhibit both superfluid behavior and superconducting behavior. this model describes a universal medium - a spinor vortex condensate - that permeates all of spacetime. it carries energy and momentum throughout the universe as it expands over time. this model provides insights into fundamental aspects of cosmology such as gravitational redshift and gravitational waves.
spacetime geometry is fractal in nature with two spatial dimensions (2d) and one temporal dimension (1d). rotational symmetry exists about all three axes - x-, y-, z-axes - manifesting as spherical symmetry with radial-symmetry along raxis, azimuthal-symmetry around φ-axis, polar-symmetry around θ-axis. translational symmetry also exists along x-, y-, z-axes allowing for wave-like propagation through space-time continuum governed by Schrödinger equation.
universal medium permeates entire cosmos from smallest scales to largest scales exhibiting properties characteristic of both superfluids (zero viscosity/zero friction/zero heat dissipation) and superconductors (superconductive state at low temperatures/no electrical resistance). this medium serves as conduit for flow of energy/momentum carrying information about events taking place within or outside its domain
fractal geometry plays an important role in describing how spatial dimensions interact with each other to create complex patterns seen throughout nature including those observed within our own cosmic neighborhood.
