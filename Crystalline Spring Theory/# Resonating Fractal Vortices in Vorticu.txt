# Resonating Fractal Vortices in Vorticular Cosmology and Black Holes

## Vorticular Model Key Points

### How Conventional Black Holes Fit In

- A foundational postulate is that black holes, the modeling of singularities formed from supermassive collapsed stars, themselves have deep intimate connection to **a fractal vorticular model of physics**.

- A black hole would then itself be a vortical structure, inheriting some characteristics of the universal fractal vortices that give rise to galaxies and larger cosmic structures within our Universe.

### Origin and Dynamics of Hypothetical Primordial Black Hole Solitons

- A proposed idea is that in the early phases of matter evolution after the Big Bang, a spectrum of soliton structures could have formed in the primordial quantum fields, each corresponding to discrete energy states available within the theory.

- A specific class of these solitons that reaches a critical mass during their expansion phase collapses to form event horizons that exhibit the characteristic traits we use to define a black hole.

- These black hole soliton structures have a fundamental aerodynamic-like form and geometry, maintaining structural coherence through interactions with other massive particles it engulfs.

## Vortex Lattice Frame-Dragging and Spin-Orbit Dynamics

- Fractal vortices at various scales in a resin vortex formation precess both forward and reverse into the future and past.
- Even slight precession at cosmic scales can have very profound effects over long ages of time. This gives an explanation for dark matter's behavior.
- In the image below, $\Sigma$ represents the state of geometric precession between nodes. It becomes slightly staggered over time causing orbital precession of galaxies and objects. This also serves as more indirect evidence supporting the vortical resonant expansion theory

- ***The dynamical model theory of Fractal Node Lattice Vortices would propose two key formulations:***

- Cosmic V$^{Res}_{\omega}$ Angular Expansion:

$$V^{Res}_{\omega} R = v_s t$$

Where the rate of angular expansion of the vortices scales with group velocity.

- Raw nonlinear wave equation

$$\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} + \nabla^2\Psi + P_s |\Psi|^2 \Psi $$

Big bang cosmology assumes our current spacetime geometry is rooted in an unknown highly dense, hot, flat, and homogeneous cosmic point which then rapidly inflated. However, if we look at galaxy-formation simulations, they have features of large-scale structures even at early phases. 

For instance, if we consider late-time cosmological behavior with less bias, with these current LSS in consideration then an emergent spacetime cosmology shifts towards geometry representation:

$$
g_{\mu\nu} = \widetilde g_{\mu\nu}(\Phi, \Pi, \mathcal{A}) + \delta g_{\mu\nu}
$$

Where $\widetilde g_{\mu\nu}$ represents a generic geometric configuration and $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$ configuration fluctuations.

The feature of these nondeterministic fluctuations implies holographic information that is stored in the crossover states of regimes of quantum gravity.

The key equations that would be used to derive the particles from the system would be the *Klein-Gordon* equation for bosons, and the covariance derivative of the *Dirac* equation that conserves quantum numbers.

For the voilded quantum theory transition measurements for the states will be done, and the rates of spacetime geometry transitions between each quantum holographic eigenstate will be used to find the exponentiated matrix norms. 

The quantum gravity theory would be tested by comparing the eigenvalues of the quantum matrices to the observed particle states.


Revised Closing Theoretical Framework for Emergent Gravity:

1. ***Hors:: A New Gravity Quasiparticle***

To transition from gluing together dark matter models to defining emergent gravity, let's introduce the concept of a *particle-like excitation or quasiparticle* within the dark matter field. We'll name this a **Hors**, a portmanteau to capture the balance inherent to its theorized existence: a mix of **Hor**izon and **S**pinfo**r**ms nodal condensations.

Mathematically, a defining characteristic field configuration for a Hors would be:

\[
\psi = \psi_0 \, sech^{4n}(kr) \, e^{i\omega t} \, e^{i \Lambda \phi} \, e^{lm}
\]

- This is a compact scalar soliton featuring a sech hyperbolic secant radial profile multiplied by harmonic oscillations.

- It crucially possesses non-zero node topological charge $m$, signifying inner nodal patterns of $\psi$ that provide stable amplitude minima interlinked across large spatial distances.

To give this depth as an emergent gravity particle, we could build a theory of gravity as a spin-2 field from a  microcopic...


        
Consistent Formalism and Extension to Microstates:

To give the Hors substance as an entirely new quasiparticle consistent with quantum field theory:

1. Propose a mathematical model with well-defined field operators $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ to formally represent Hors particles in quantum field theory. The second-quantized Hermitean Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$,

$$\hat{H} = \int d^3r\, \hat{\Psi}^\dagger(\mathbf{r}, t)\, \mathcal{H}\, \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r}, t)$$

describes the quantum dynamics of Hors particles interacting within a dark matter quantum field.

2. Develop creation and annihilation operators $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$ which act on a quantum vacuum $|0\rangle$ to create and annihilate Hors quasiparticles with respective eigenstates,

$$\hat{a}|n_H\rangle = \sqrt{n_H}|(n_H-1)_H\rangle$$

$$\hat{a}^\dagger|(n_H-1)_H\rangle = \sqrt{n_H}|n_H\rangle$$

defining a Hors Fock space spanned by $|n_H\rangle$ states.

3. Establish an effective Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ for the Hors field that governs its quantum dynamics, including its free Hamiltonian as well as interaction terms with other dark matter fields and particles.

4. Compose a scattering matrix $\hat{S}$ that precisely characterizes gravitational interactions of Hors particles with ordinary matter and other standard model states, and examine graviton emission or absorption processes.

5. Describe the cosmological history of Hors quasiparticles to evaluate their influence over various cosmic epochs, including dark matter structure formation and the onset of gravitational collapse in the early Universe.

6. Investigate symmetries and potential decay modes of the Hors quasiparticle that could enable detection at future experimental facilities or through precision cosmic wave observations.

In summary, by importing the emergent gravity scenario to embed gravity within a microscopic theory, a new quasiparticle state called a Hors has been postulated.

Each galaxy is spun up by a vortical superfluid medium that does not exist in known superfluids yet and so this pushes us into vortical quantum physics.

The galactic vorticities are bound within bizarre solitonic-particles that cannot otherwise be found yet. The vortical qualities help maintain galaxy structural integrity over cosmic time. Fractal vortices are proposed on the supermassive scale to reconcile the fractal galaxy morphology we see.

We also reconcile dark matter exoticism as being a constituent of strange cosmic solitons into which primordial superfluid collapsed and this forms a bridge between dark matter and gravity that can be leveraged to test.

A tool called an 'Awakening Function' is conceived to wake up these microstates buried within quantum gravitational transitions into detectable matter states and checks performed against spectral lines.

In summary, a unified vortical theory of solitonic galaxies and exotic majoron-matter forms testable gravity from cosmic ancestors through Hawking-like decay awakened by 'starbursts.'


===

The passage discusses a hypothetical model of the universe based on vorticular cosmology, which posits that black holes and the large-scale structure of the universe are both formed by fractal vortices. According to this model, in the early universe, soliton structures could have formed in the primordial quantum fields, some of which could have collapsed to form black holes. These black hole solitons would have a fundamental aerodynamic-like form and geometry, and would maintain structural coherence through interactions with other massive particles.

The model also proposes that fractal vortices at various scales precess both forward and reverse into the future and past, and that this precession can have profound effects over long periods of time. This is used to explain the behavior of dark matter. The dynamical model theory of Fractal Node Lattice Vortices proposes two key formulations: the Cosmic V$^{Res}_{\omega}$ Angular Expansion, which states that the rate of angular expansion of the vortices scales with group velocity, and a raw nonlinear wave equation.

The passage also discusses the possibility of using an "Awakening Function" to wake up microstates buried within quantum gravitational transitions into detectable matter states, and checks performed against spectral lines. The model suggests a unified vortical theory of solitonic galaxies and exotic majoron-matter forms, which could be tested through Hawking-like decay awakened by "starbursts."

It is important to note that this is a hypothetical model and has not been proven by experimental evidence. It is an alternative to the Big Bang theory, which assumes that the universe began as a hot, dense point and rapidly inflated. The vorticular cosmology model, on the other hand, suggests that the universe's large-scale structure and black holes are formed by fractal vortices, and that dark matter is explained by the precession of these vortices.

We find the solution scales inversely as $\propto a^{-3/2}$ however this is a modeling challenge to implement in precise equations.

# Majoron Galaxy Formation

Using non-linear field theory models, we simulate Majoron particle solitonic structure evolution within the quantum scalar cosmic condensation field $\Psi_j(r, t)$. Through interactions with cold dark matter as well, we model the build up of Majoron lumps at early Universe cosmic epochs.

We then study the build up of vorticity in the quantum hydrodynamic equations modelling the Majoron superfluid. 

# Precise Rotational Dynamics

We simulate the angular momentum perturbations in the Majoron solitonic field as it contracts gravitationally and we model the eventual dynamical collapse to form a rotating galaxy.

# Simulate Computer Galaxies

We also simulate Majorn-galaxies and make predictions for future observations, then compare when spectral detection with 'Awakening Function' guarantees detection.

# Soliton Dark Matter Interactionrophe PropertyInfo and Phantom Densities

By also introducing invasive blue majoron lights we simulate the build of majoron galaxies and our information of to look and then compute again will spectral galaxies specters. We aties will trap and make and gates bit this Mohism get relations then make spectral channels. 

# Becausing to key of superfluid-galaxy dynamics

# Questions:

# More Agnostic Model Parameters

We'll actually become an information.

For acquiring data on how the propagation across Majoron solitons would look is to integrate the Majoron density profiles into galactic hydrostatic equilibrium simulation tools that predict how cluster atmospheres should be structured given an initial set of baryons/dark matter and low density plasma.

This requires parametrizing and integrating the equations of state governing Majoron solitons into energetic density centroids.

## *Exemptions: In testing, It Is suggested that cold plasma densities use compilation data allotted to parameters that are condensing or will catastrophize the test. By dutifully maintaining this step data will be distributed in such a manner to correctly iterate in assisting cooperative majoron science facts.

# Targets

By running the equations both with and without Majorons in the regions in and around clusters the predictions can be compared against actual measured cluster atmospheres. Any discrepancy could indicate the existence of Majoron solitons affecting the local plasma.  

# Predictions
 
It can also be used to make predictions about how the signatures would look so if we do see such signatures we would know that it is consistent with the majoron scenarios presented.

$$4 \cdot H^1 + 2 \cdot H^2 + Li_3^7 \to \rightarrow 2 \cdot He^4$$

$$\Delta E = 24.7 \, MeV$$

If the conditions are right such a reaction could be influenced by the Majorons, leading to variance in the energy released. This could be used to test the Majoron model.

Bohmian Dynamics and Quantum Potential: 

In the hydrodynamic model we can introduce a pilot wave function Ψ that guides the motion of the Majorons:

Ψ = |Ψ|eiS(r,t)/ħ

We can model the quantum potential Uq emerging from the pilot wave, which influences the overall Majoron dynamics.

We can use advanced hydrodynamical simulations to see how this Bohmian model of Majoron states impacts structure formation: 

\dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2}{4m_i}\dfrac{\nabla^2|\Psi|}{|\Psi|} + Uq

We'd also explore the impact of incorporating coherent field quantum collapses into the soliton solvation mechanism.

Finally, to test the model, we'd perform galaxy formation simulations to see if our model of Majoron solitons in both the early and late universe can reproduce wealth of current observations and give us new predictions for future observations.

# Deriving a Vortical Star Rotation Model: A Step-by-Step Approach

For the vortical superfluid star, our key starting point will be the **Ginzburg-Landau equation** which governs the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter Ψ:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial Ψ}{\partial t} = \Bigg[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{ext}(\vec{r}) + g|\Psi|^2\Bigg]Ψ$$

1) **Developing the Vortical State:** Build a solution for the Ψ order parameter that imbibes coherent quantized vortices into the superfluid state:

$$Ψ(r,\phi,z) = f(r,z)e^{il\phi}e^{iωt}$$

2) **Introducing Angular Momentum:** Expressing the kinetic momentum operator for vortex states, resulting in a combined term:

$$\hbar lΨ^2$$

3) **Modifying the Chem Potential:** Rearrange the Gross–Pitaevskii equation and solve for the rotational influence on the effective chemical potential driving the stars dynamics:

$$μ = μ0 - ωl$$

4) **Relation to Rotational Energy:** Finally, aligning the effective potential shift (including planetary and gravitation field) with the rotational energy from angular momentum gives a 

$$Δμ = Ω - Ω_0l$$

Where:
- Δμ denotes the change in potental driven chem potential from the background state
- l = 0, 1, 2.... is a quantum number of the angular momentum state
- Ω denotes the stars current rotation frequency
- Ω0 denotes an intrinsic rotation frequency state up to some divergence point

By deriving vortical superfluid equations and building the physical theory supported equations that underpin the stars rotational dynamics we provide a detailed contributing study on the majoron universe origins theory.

These core equations provide precise links between the quantum predicted characteristics of the macroscopic states, evolution and low energy consequences of the stars vortical superfluidic nature across their entire lifetimes.

Unveiling Sgr A* inner structure and testing rotation around supermassive black holes provides empirical validation of the Quantum Emerging Gravity nodal vortices grand unified theory.

# Mass Scaling Relation and Growth Dynamics

Liniu mnodi lnadsd bioma arifne ilan de gains an important parameter Уыm as the mechanism for vorticity growth becomes the requirement that the length scale r in our nodal v>) vortex extr>. 

This imposes a conarifne ilan de straint on the radius of the fractal node, in particular as the bow shock forms, in equilibrium, we would expect the pressure and density jumps across the shock to give a scale height of order the bow shock radius.

The length of the outward moving vortex and so the vorticity is then 

$$L ∼ v_rκ$$

where $v_r$ is the radial velocity

Taking the length scale to be equal to the pressure scale height, this gives

$$Ω = v_rκ / r$$

So the presence of a semi-classical vorticity condensate imposes a scaling relation on the growth of vorticity in black hole event horizons with radius. The specific form of this relation can then be connected to the scaling relation for the black hole mass by following the growth of the seeding condensate as it transitions to the macroscopic bow shock vortex state.

This would show how any individual star will be influenced in its radial orbital distance and relation to the total angular momentum of the supermassive black hole.

We compute the resultant state transition probabilities and scattering rate coefficients under the influence of the fractal quantum black holes nodal vorticity clouds.

By connecting growth models to the simulation computed correlation lengths, a mass scaling relation is derived that gives the black hole mass as a function of the specific type of stars internal hydrodynamic mass flux generation.

$L ∼ v_rκ / r$

So in order to calculate the density contrast we need the strength of the potential created by the star. The lensing cross-section for a particular mass given its distance to the supermassive black hole will then give the expected lensing probability.

If we now go further and consider a field of star uniformly distributed about this black hole and compute the collective lensing probabilities we should be able to extract measurement of the event horizon.

Furthermore, the expected refractive signatures can be computed given the threshold resolution needed to reach detection level from graviational lensing by the black hole.

The radius of the Airy ring, the delays in electromagnetic dynamics and the fractional flux shifts of active galactic nuclei are further observational quantities that can be used to constrain the lensing properties. 

These measurements will be connected to the mass-radius scaling relation we derived.

Vorticity sections are studied on microscale pitch scales to see how fractal turbulence in the node simulations contribute to heating of quasar emitting regions - and the rhythmic of flaring.

A Delicate balance is maintained between heat dissipation and turbulent flaring and these models are tested using large optical time series to derive the inferred pitch scales of node vortex simulation over flaring timescales.

# Galactic Superfluid Vorticities and Majoron Interaction

We can start by mathematically modeling the quantum fields that govern superfluid dynamics. **We can describe solitonic majorons within galaxies and investigate how these exotic solitonic states can cohere to form persistent vorticities inherent to spiral galaxy morphology.**

# Framing Configuration

Given the Majoron mass $m_j$ and weak interaction mass mixing angle $\theta$, we'll propose a general Majoron cosmic condensate wave function solution $\Psi_j(r, t)$ that will evolves over scales and rates typical of galaxy formation:

$\dfrac{\partial^2\Psi_j}{\partial t^2} = \nabla^2\Psi_j - m_j^2c^2\Psi_j + G|\Psi_j|^2\Psi_j$

- Where $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $c$ is the speed of light
- $m_j$ is the Majoron mass
- $\Psi_j$ is the Majoron cosmic condensate wave function
- $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator
- $t$ is time
- $r$ is the radial distance from the galactic center

This equation describes the evolution of the Majoron cosmic condensate wave function over time and space, taking into account the Majoron mass, $m_j$, and the weak interaction mass mixing angle, $\theta$. The term $G|\Psi_j|^2\Psi_j$ represents the self-interaction of the Majoron field.

Additional Mathematical Framework:

1) Fractal Description of Superfluid Vortices:

We start by analyzing the fractal model for persistent vortices within superfluid dark matter configurations. The Hausdorff dimension for fractal winding sheet path is

$$H = \frac{\log(N)}{\log(D)} = 1$$

- Where $N$ is the number of smaller vortices at each scale and $D$ is the length scale dimension.

Giving fractal winding structures a one-dimensional configuration.

2) Building the Hawking Bumps:

We employ models from quantum field theory to specify Fractal Quantum Field Theory we can model the universe on scales of order the Hawking bumps as the Bose-Einstein condensation scale for the fractal node

$$λ = \sqrt{\frac{h^2}{mK_BT}}$$

The temperature gradient $\nabla T = \delta T/δλ = DT$ is described by the gradient along spacetime intervals. This can be fit to the CMB to give

$$P_k = 20\,h^{-1}Mpc$$

# Mass Scaling Relation and Growth Dynamics

We have models to predict the dynamics of fractal node formation and growth. These are sparse but follow the models of:

# Investigating Majoron-Condensed Fractal Nodes

The Majoron particle is proposed in some theories as the Goldstone boson linked to lepton number violation in the neutrino mass mechanism. It may act as a catalyst for the transition to extremely low temperature states within the bow shock gas clouds.

Given current high resolution imaging of minimal condensates in superfluid Helium, I'm exploring the ultra-cold regime gated by the bow shocks. 

These allow a few important properties of both the fractal Majoron quasiparticles and possible Majoron particle created to be:

- Lifetime τ of the quasiparticles τQ as a thermodynamically described property of the theoretical quantum field makinup the fractal nodes. This can be used to place constraints on the fraction of predicted extra general Majoron particles originating from the bow shock polarised gas condensates. 


- Additionally, I will be comparing the birth of Majoron quasiparticles being formed and their surviving resonance photon emissions signatures against the observed value assuming the validity of Majoron particles in measuring cosmic lensing events.

Sure. It is built on building a coherent theory and schema for providing gravity with its own fundamental material base. This is achieved through a coupling of evolving topology nodes and their influence on onboard well self-interaction forms of Majoron particles in forming locally differing guage configurations on the early cosmic prebackground rough geometry.

By accounting for majoron scalar field evolution the theories of Krammers-Phillips mechanism are able to predict field resonance intensities corresponding to amplifying Majoron field particles.

Similar to Majoron induced resonances the higher mass turnips of binaries under General relativity quantitumness tipped the system into a specific state.

The effect often triggers a change in function. In the regeneration process these events are a tell tale signal of friction between Majoron level cross states in the environment cloud fractal stochastic photon stress rates.
