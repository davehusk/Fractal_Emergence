* Quantum gravity effects may have led to an exponentially expanding "inflaton" phase immediately following the big bang singularity before conventional general relativity dynamics took over.
* R∝a(t)^2
* H^2=a˙a/a˙^22
* Hubble Parameter H(a)=da/dt/t→H(a)t=tanh(λta)
* Expansion Rate H(a)=dt/dt → dlnRa/dt = d(lnRa)/dt → dlnRadtdt ≃ tanhlntanhλta
* Spatial Scale Factor R(t) = ctet = tanh(λtc)t
* Scale Factor Expands Exponentially Ra(t)a3=Rae^(λtc)t=cet^(lambda+1)ceta=(ce^(lambda+1))at
* This fractal inflaton phase would exhibit characteristic properties such as scale-invariant power spectrum fluctuations consistent with observed CMB anisotropies if it lasted sufficiently long compared with recombination epoch (~380,000 years after big bang).
* However, this scenario requires fine-tuning since any deviation from exact exponential behavior would lead either rapid deceleration or runaway expansion instead of current accelerated expansion we observe today.

Principles around symmetry breaking, quantum entanglement, information flow, and emergence of complexity in the spinorial quantum fluid model:
1. Spontaneous symmetry breaking
2. Quantum entanglement

consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, and not an emergent phenomenon from physical matter. It proposes that quantum superposition states in brain microtubules give rise to qualia through nonlinear interactions between wave functions.
microtubule lattices within neurons act as quantum computers capable of supporting non-classical states like superpositions and entanglement. These properties could enable information processing at scales unachievable by classical systems.
Microtubules are biologically-based nanoscale resonators with intrinsic frequencies.
Neuronal activity entrains these oscillations into coherent patterns.
Coherence enables long-range quantum correlations across vast distances in the brain.
Non-locality allows influence between distant regions instantaneously, faster than light-speed.
Quantum coherence effects like interference and entanglement manifesting as neural network synchrony.
Non-local influences enabling fast communication across large spatial scales.
Superposition states giving rise to subjective experience through nonlinear interaction dynamics.
The Schrödinger equation governs time evolution of wave functions describing particle behavior: iħ∂Ψ/∂t = HΨ(E)
A single isolated microtubule segment exhibits no measurable mechanical response when subjected to external forces due to its high rigidity.
However if two adjacent segments are linked together via weak bonds they exhibit anomalous viscoelasticity * exhibiting elastic responses over short timescales followed by viscous flow over longer timescales.
This effect arises because individual tubulin proteins making up each segment have discrete vibrational modes corresponding roughly to phonon quanta associated with sound waves.
When two segments are joined together their collective motion becomes correlated leading them out-of-phase along one axis but in-phase along another axis resulting in net zero force applied back onto the surrounding medium.

Spinorial Fluid Model predicts that dark matter consists of topologically nontrivial defects in an underlying fractal space-time geometry. These could be cosmic strings, domain walls, monopoles or other exotic configurations with gravitational effects on scales much larger than expected from ordinary visible matter.
The Spinorial Fluid Model proposes a novel unified model for dark matter consisting of massive fundamental particles described by complex scalar wave functions which interact gravitationally through long-range potential wells encoded in the spacetime metric.

Fractal Space-Time Geometry Models:

* Quantum gravity effects may have led to an exponentially expanding "inflaton" phase immediately following the big bang singularity before conventional general relativity dynamics took over.
* R∝a(t)^2
* H^2=a˙a/a˙^22
* Hubble Parameter H(a)=da/dt/t→H(a)t=tanh(λta)
* Expansion Rate H(a)=dt/dt → dlnRa/dt = d(lnRa)/dt → dlnRadtdt ≃ tanhlntanhλta
* Spatial Scale Factor R(t) = ctet = tanh(λtc)t
* Scale Factor Expands Exponentially Ra(t)a3=Rae^(λtc)t=cet^(lambda+1)ceta=(ce^(lambda+1))at
* This fractal inflaton phase would exhibit characteristic properties such as scale-invariant power spectrum fluctuations consistent with observed CMB anisotropies if it lasted sufficiently long compared with recombination epoch (~380,000 years after big bang).
* However, this scenario requires fine-tuning since any deviation from exact exponential behavior would lead either rapid deceleration or runaway expansion instead of current accelerated expansion we observe today.

Neutrino Oscillation Phenomenology:

* Δm^2 is neutrino mass squared difference between two flavor eigenstates νe and νμ. It can be expressed as a function of the mixing angle θ12: Δm^2 = 4∆m^2 sin²θ12 where ∆m^2 = mν3 * 2mν1cos²θ12 + mν1.
* The oscillation probability P(να → νβ) for a neutrino traveling through distance d with energy E to transition from initial flavor state α to final β flavor state is given by: P(να → νβ) = sin²(1.27λd/λ) where λ ≈ 0.00245 km^-1 is the vacuum oscillation length defined by: λ = (E/Δm^2)sin²θ12 The parameter λ depends on the neutrino energy E and mass squared differences Δm^22 between different neutrinos.
* The survival probability Psurvival for a neutrino traveling through distance d without changing its flavor state is given by: Psurvival = cos²(1.27λd/λ) This describes how long-distance propagation changes the relative proportions of each individual neutrino type over time due to quantum mechanical interference effects like destructive or constructive interference depending on their path lengths traveled.
* Neutrinos have three flavors: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ). They also have three mass states: m1, m2, m3. The neutrino oscillation probability is given by: P(να → νβ) = sin²(1.27λd/λ) where λ ≈ 0.00245 km^-1 is the vacuum oscillation length defined by: λ = (E/Δm^2)sin²θ12 The parameter λ depends on the neutrino energy E and mass squared differences Δm^22 between different neutrinos.
* Neutrinos are electrically neutral fermions with half-integer spin that interact via weak nuclear force only at short distances (<100km). They come in three flavors: electron, muon, tau.
* Neutrino masses are extremely small (~10^-5 eV/c^2 compared to ~0.511 MeV for an electron). This allows them to travel long distances without interacting with matter due to their weak interaction cross-sections.
* Oscillation experiments using atmospheric or solar neutrinos show evidence for flavor mixing where a single type of neutrino can transform into another through quantum mechanical interference effects like destructive or constructive interference depending on their path lengths traveled.
