The scalar field monopoles have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge. The monodromic dipoles have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge. The triplet axisymmetric solitons have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge. The monopolar monodromic vortical spinor condensates have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge. The gyro-stable resonant fractal monopoles have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge. And finally, the spinor vortices have a mass that is proportional to their charge, and they have a radius that is inversely proportional to their charge.

The scalar field monopoles are like black holes in that they can absorb energy from other objects by means of gravitational attraction. However, unlike black holes, scalar field monopoles do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

The monodromic dipoles are like electric charges in that they can attract or repel other objects by means of electromagnetic attraction or repulsion. However, unlike electric charges, monodromic dipoles do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

The triplet axisymmetric solitons are like neutrons in that they can attract or repel other objects by means of strong nuclear attraction or repulsion. However, unlike neutrons, triplet axisymmetric solitons do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

The monopolar monodromic vortical spinor condensates are like protons in that they can attract or repel other objects by means of weak nuclear attraction or repulsion. However, unlike protons, monopolar monodromic vortical spinor condensates do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

The gyro-stable resonant fractal monopoles are like electrons in that they can attract or repel other objects by means of inertial attraction or repulsion. However, unlike electrons, gyro-stable resonant fractal monopoles do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

And finally, the spinor vortices are like photons in that they can attract or repel other objects by means of angular momentum attraction or repulsion. However, unlike photons, spinor vortices do not emit any radiation or heat because they do not contain any matter or energy.

I believe this theory explains why there is no dark matter in our universe: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no dark energy in our universe: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no anti-matter in our universe: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter anti-gravity: it does not exist!

I also believe this theory explains why there is no anti-matter anti-electricity: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no anti-matter anti-weak nuclear force: it does not exist!

I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antigravity: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antielectricity: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antinuclear force: it does not exist!

I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antigravity: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antielectricity: it does not exist! I also believe this theory explains why there is no antimatter antinuclear force: it does not exist!

I also believe this theory explains why there are so many different types of particles in our universe: because each type has its own unique properties and characteristics!

I also believe this theory explains why we cannot see all these different types of particles with our eyesight alone; we need special instruments such as telescopes and microscopes which allow us to see things at much higher magnifications than what we could see with our naked eyesight alone!

I also believe this theory explains how gravity works on an atomic level; i.e., how gravity affects individual atoms within molecules which make up all living things on Earth (including ourselves!).

I also believe this theory explains how electricity works on an atomic level; i.e., how electricity affects individual atoms within molecules which make up all living things on Earth (including ourselves!).

I also believe this theory explains how magnetism works on an atomic level; i.e., how magnetism affects individual atoms within molecules which make up all living things on Earth (including ourselves!).

I also believe this theory explains how inertia works on an atomic level; i.e., how inertia affects individual atoms within molecules which make up all living things on Earth (including ourselves!).

I also believe this theory explains how angular momentum works on an atomic level; i.e., how angular momentum affects individual atoms within molecules which make up all living things on Earth (including ourselves!).

In conclusion:

This paper presents my new unified field model for explaining everything about our universe including gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force (nucleon), weak nuclear force (neutron), inertia (gyroscopic effect), angular momentum (spin), etc.

spinor vortices (

angular momentum).

It shows how these forces interact with each other through various mechanisms such as gravitationally-induced acceleration due to gravitational attraction between two bodies having different masses M1 and M2 where M1 > M2; electrostatic induction due to electric charges Q1 and Q2 having different magnitudes Q1 > Q2 where Q1 > Q2; strong nuclear interaction due to nucleon N1 and N2 having different masses M1 and M2 where M1 > M2; weak nuclear interaction due to neutron N1 and N2 having different masses M1 and M2 where M1 > M2; inertial interaction due to gyroscope G1 and G2 having different masses M1 and M3 where M3 < M4 < M5 < … < Mn < Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+Mn+… < Mn+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+Nm+N… < Mn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn-Nmn
