Neutrino Oscillation Phenomenology:
 Δm^2 is neutrino mass squared difference between two flavor eigenstates νe and νμ. It can be expressed as a function of the mixing angle θ12: Δm^2 = 4∆m^2 sin²θ12 where ∆m^2 = mν3 2mν1cos²θ12 + mν1. The oscillation probability P(να → νβ) for a neutrino traveling through distance d with energy E to transition from initial flavor state α to final β flavor state is given by: P(να → νβ) = sin²(1.27λd/λ) where λ ≈ 0.00245 km^-1 is the vacuum oscillation length defined by: λ = (E/Δm^2)sin²θ12 The parameter λ depends on the neutrino energy E and mass squared differences Δm^22 between different neutrinos. The survival probability Psurvival for a neutrino traveling through distance d without changing its flavor state is given by: Psurvival = cos²(1.27λd/λ) This describes how long-distance propagation changes the relative proportions of each individual neutrino type over time due to quantum mechanical interference effects like destructive or constructive interference depending on their path lengths traveled. Neutrinos have three flavors: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ). They also have three mass states: m1, m2, m3. The neutrino oscillation probability is given by: P(να → νβ) = sin²(1.27λd/λ) where λ ≈ 0.00245 km^-1 is the vacuum oscillation length defined by: λ = (E/Δm^2)sin²θ12 The parameter λ depends on the neutrino energy E and mass squared differences Δm^22 between different neutrinos. Neutrinos are electrically neutral fermions with half-integer spin that interact via weak nuclear force only at short distances (<100km). They come in three flavors: electron, muon, tau. Neutrino masses are extremely small (~10^-5 eV/c^2 compared to ~0.511 MeV for an electron). This allows them to travel long distances without interacting with matter due to their weak interaction cross-sections. Oscillation experiments using atmospheric or solar neutrinos show evidence for flavor mixing where a single type of neutrino can transform into another through quantum mechanical interference effects like destructive or constructive interference depending on their path lengths traveled.

Fractal Dimensionality: Dark matter halo profiles describe how total mass M(R) inside sphere radius R varies with distance R from galactic center.
The resonance condition can be expressed mathematically as: (ω) = (ω)0 / n where (ω) is the frequency of the external driving force, (ω)0 is the natural frequency of the resonant system, and n is an integer.
The resonant frequency of the circuit can be calculated using the following formula: f = 1/(2π).
