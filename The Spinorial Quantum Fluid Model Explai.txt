Vortex tubes are structures found throughout nature ranging from microscopic scale up to macroscopic scale. Vortex tubes consist primarily two components: 1) core region containing rotational motion known centrifugal force 2) annular region extending radially away from center characterized axial velocity gradient associated pressure difference driving flow tangential direction outward inward depending on relative magnitude these parameters configuration
Quantum field theory: The spinor vortex condensate is a quantum fluid that exhibits superfluidity and superconductivity. It is a macroscopic quantum state that arises from the collective behavior of particles in a many-body system.
Unified field theory: The spinor vortex condensate is the unified field in which all forces of nature emerge as manifestations of energy and momentum flowing through spacetime. It is a universal medium that permeates all of spacetime and carries energy and momentum throughout the universe.
Cosmology: Gravitational redshift and gravitational waves are manifestations of energy and momentum flow through the spinor vortex condensate in an expanding universe. As the universe expands, the spinor vortex condensate cools and loses energy, leading to gravitational redshift. Gravitational waves are signatures of energy-momentum flow through spacetime mediated by the spinor vortex condensate.
Quantum fluid behavior: Superfluidity, superconductivity, zero viscosity, zero friction, and zero heat dissipation are properties of the spinor vortex condensate. These properties arise from the fact that the condensate is a macroscopic quantum state that exhibits coherent behavior.
Fractal dimension: Spatial dimensions are two-dimensional (2d), and temporal dimensions are one-dimensional (1d). The fractal dimension of spacetime geometry is 2, which suggests that the universe has a complex, hierarchical structure that is not fully captured by traditional Euclidean geometry.
Rotational symmetry: Rotational symmetry exists about all three axes (x-, y-, z-axes), manifesting as spherical symmetry with radial symmetry along the r-axis, azimuthal symmetry around the φ-axis, and polar symmetry around the θ-axis.
Translational symmetry: Translational symmetry exists along x-, y-, z-axes, allowing for wave-like propagation through the spacetime continuum governed by the Schrödinger equation.
Universal medium: The spinor vortex condensate permeates the entire cosmos from the smallest scales to the largest scales, exhibiting properties characteristic of both superfluids and superconductors. It serves as a conduit for the flow of energy and momentum, carrying information about events taking place within or outside its domain.
Fractal geometry: Fractal geometry plays an important role in describing how spatial dimensions interact with each other to create complex patterns seen throughout nature, including those observed within our own cosmic neighborhood. The fractal structure of spacetime geometry suggests that the universe has a self-similar structure at different scales, with patterns repeating at increasingly smaller scales. Fractal patterns in the cosmic microwave background radiation, supernovae, and galaxy clustering provide observational evidence for this phenomenon.
Structural defects: The turbulent eddies and vortices characteristic of turbulent flow conditions are analogous to topological defects in a spinor vortex condensate, providing a mechanism for dissipative energy exchange that gives rise to friction and viscous drag forces. The interactions between the vortices and the topological defects give rise to the behavior observed in turbulent systems, such as gravitational wave production and the spiral galaxy structure.
Dark energy: The energy and momentum contained within the spinor vortex condensate drive the expansion of the universe, as described by the Friedman–Robertson–Walker equations. Dark energy makes up approximately 70% of total energy density in the cosmos and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe observed today.
Dark matter: The spinor vortex condensate provides a natural mechanism for the formation of dark matter. Gravitational interaction mediated by the spinor vortex condensate leads to hierarchical clustering of matter and formation of topological defects, which serve as seeds for the growth of structures in the early universe and give rise to a relic density of dark matter today. The fractal nature of spacetime geometry facilitates the self-similar clustering of dark matter, providing a framework for understanding how dark matter is distributed throughout our cosmic neighborhood.
The Spinorial Quantum Fluid Model proposes that dark matter consists primarily two components 1) core region containing rotational motion known centrifugal force 2) annular region extending radially away from center characterized axial velocity gradient associated pressure difference driving tangential outward inward flow depending on relative magnitude parameters configuration

Quantum field theory: Spinors represent particles with half-integer spins (e.g., fermions). Vortices can be described using complex scalar fields with phase singularities corresponding to vorticity values equal zero one integer multiples thereof forming quantized vortices called "vortex lines" when confined spatially finite extent system size L .
Unified field theory: Spacetime is viewed as a continuous medium permeated by dynamic fluctuations arising from exchange interaction between particles comprising it termed "quantum vacuum fluctuations." These fluctuations lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking resulting formation localized regions where local order parameter takes non-zero value representing coherent state referred condensed phase . In case considered here spinorial vortex condensate , order parameter corresponds complex scalar field ψ describing distribution amplitude probability density function over position space R^3 .

Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is electromagnetic radiation left over from early universe shortly after Big Bang event.
