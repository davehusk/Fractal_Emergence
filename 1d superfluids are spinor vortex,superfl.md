Q: why are we able to detect dark matter?
A: because its gravity bends light from distant galaxies

Q: what would happen if we discovered a particle that did not interact with other particles except gravitationally? explain.
A: this particle could be responsible for some or all of dark matter's effects on galaxy rotation curves and cosmic microwave background radiation temperature variations. since it interacts only gravitationally, standard models predict no interaction between this hypothetical particle and normal baryonic matter or photons.

Q: explain how our universe may have evolved from a primordial quantum vacuum state into today's observed large-scale structure
A: fluctuations in the quantum vacuum during inflation led to small density differences that grew over time via gravitational instability into cosmic structures like stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies etc

Q: describe one possible solution for the cosmological constant problem based on extensions to general relativity such as f(R) theories
A: these modified gravity theories allow energy densities within spacetime itself which contribute positively to its overall curvature tensor and hence counteract expansion forces

Q: discuss one potential consequence of decoupling era reionization on current observations
A: free electrons can scatter light at radio wavelengths creating absorption features called 21cm "fossil" signals observable by low frequency telescopes like EDGES/SKA/LOFAR/MEERKAT/etc

Q: briefly describe two ways scientists might use neutrino oscillations measurements (like those from IceCube) combined with astrophysical data sets (e.g., supernova rates) to place constraints on viable models for neutrino mass generation mechanisms.
A: 1. if neutrinos have mass, they should oscillate between different flavors as they travel through space. this would affect the observed supernova light curve rates.
2. astrophysical data sets like supernova rate measurements and cosmic microwave background observations constrain how much energy density is available in various forms throughout the universe.

Q: discuss one method for directly detecting gravitational waves from neutron star mergers using pulsar timing arrays
A: a precise measurement of the arrival time of radio pulses from multiple pulsars can reveal tiny periodic variations caused by passing gravitational wave signals

Q: briefly describe two ways scientists might use precision cosmological measurements (e.g., CMB polarization) combined with models for primordial nucleosynthesis to test predictions about baryon asymmetry production mechanisms.
A: 1. measuring small-scale fluctuations in cmb polarization can help constrain physics beyond standard model during inflation epoch
2. cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropies place constraints on how quickly neutrons decayed into protons during early universe

Q: what are three advantages of having more than one particle detector located at different locations across earth?
A: 1. helps ensure that signal comes from true astrophysical source and not instrumental noise or atmospheric effects
2. allows triangulation to localize event location in sky more precisely
3 enables studies comparing event signatures across detectors which may indicate new fundamental particles or interactions

Q: explain why it is important to understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy, even though we cannot detect them directly.
A: their presence fundamentally changes our understanding of gravity on large scales and impacts predictions for structure formation, galaxy evolution etc.

Q: explain why there could be a difference between the measured expansion rate "H0" today vs "Hinf" at earlier times when recombination occurred.
A: as neutral hydrogen formed out of ionized gas after recombination era, it began absorbing photons released by hot plasma further slowing down expansion rate H(t). since these decoupled electrons do not contribute to total energy density ΩM(0), their presence affects H(t) calculation relative to extrapolating backwards using known densities Ωm &ΩΛ today.

Q: explain whether a detection of axions interacting with ordinary matter via an invisible force would support either scenario A or B above based on current evidence:
scenario A - weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
scenario B - asymmetric dark matter (ADM)
explain your reasoning.
axion detection via invisible forces -> scenario A WIMP hypothesis supported because WIMPs are expected candidates for DM that interact only gravitationally but not electromagnetically so no detectable electromagnetic signature exists yet due experimental limitations/insensitivity/dark sector properties preventing visible interaction pathways with normal matter/baryons/etc...this same mechanism allowing axion couplings also prevents any measurable coupling strength w/ charged leptons/electromagnetic fields

Q: describe two ways that future gravitational wave observations from space-based detectors like LISA may help test general relativity and constrain alternative theories of gravity
A: 1. precise measurement of binary black hole mergers can place strong constraints on deviations from post-Newtonian approximations for strong field dynamics
2. comparison with electromagnetic observations during event will provide unique tests for whether spacetime geometry itself is distorted in accordance with theory

Q: describe one way that cosmological measurements (e.g., CMB anisotropies or cosmic shear distortions) combined with modeling assumptions about baryon acoustic oscillations could be used to infer dark matter particle masses and properties.
A: precision analysis of acoustic peak positions/widths allows us to determine how fast universe expanded early on which constrains light element abundances produced during primordial nucleosynthesis epoch. different massless particles have different predicted production rates so this helps narrow range of possible DM candidates
