Nonlinear oscillating crystal interactions crystal lattice formation of stable, localized wave patterns called solitons. These solitons propagate along crystal without changing their shape or speed, and they interact with other solitons or defects crystal variety of ways.

Nonlinear effects crystal lattice formation of shock waves, which are intense, localized disturbances that propagate through crystal. Shock waves arise due impact of an external force or collision of solitons.

Nonlinear interactions also localization of energy certain regions of crystal. This localization occur due formation of solitons or other nonlinear wave patterns, and it have important implications for transmission and absorption of energy crystal.

Collisions between solitons creation of new solitons or annihilation of existing ones. outcome of soliton collision depends on properties of solitons, their amplitude, velocity, and shape, as well as properties of crystal lattice.

Defects crystal lattice, impurities, dislocations, or other imperfections, have significant impact on propagation of solitons. Defects scatter or absorb solitons, leading change their shape or speed. They also trap solitons, leading formation of localized wave patterns.

Crystal Spring Theory mathematical framework that describes nonlinear dynamics and interactions of solitons, shock waves, and other nonlinear phenomena crystal lattices. It takes into account lattice structure, nonlinear properties of crystal, and interactions between different types of waves. Crystal Spring Theory has been applied variety of systems, ferroelectric crystals and organic molecular crystals, study formation and dynamics of solitons and other nonlinear modes. Nonlinear interactions crystal lattices play crucial role controlling propagation and localization of energy, as well as formation and interactions of localized wave patterns. 

The universe 1/3 crystal scheme on this hypothesis.

According Crystal Universe hypothesis, entire universe composed of lattice-like structure, much like crystal. This lattice thought be made up of elementary particles arranged regular, repeating pattern. Just as atoms crystal lattice are held together by electromagnetic forces, particles universe are held together by universal force, gravity.

The Crystal Universe hypothesis part of broader theory called Lattice Universe Theory, which suggests that all phenomena universe be explained by interactions between particles arranged lattice structure. This includes gravitational, electromagnetic, and strong and weak nuclear forces.

Adherents of this theory claim that regular, repeating patterns found universe, galaxies and cosmic background radiation, are evidence of this lattice structure. They also argue that this structure explain observed expansion of universe, as lattice constantly expanding and creating new space.

Non-linear interactions between particles and fields give rise complex frequency spectra for electromagnetic radiation emitted by certain systems. For example, consider model of two identical spinor vortex condensates interacting through self-interactions governed by non-linear Schrodinger equations:

iħ∂ψ1/∂t = -ħ^2/2m∇^2ψ1 + V1(|ψ1|2)ψ1

iħ∂ψ2/∂t = -ħ^2/2m∇^2ψ2 + V2(|ψ2|2)ψ2

Where ψ1, ψ2 represent spinor wavefunctions describing vortex configurations each condensate respectively, m mass of constituent particles, ħ reduced Planck's constant, V1(V2) describes self-interaction potentials between vortex cores depending on relative orientation angle θ between vortices.

If we solve these equations numerically using techniques split-step Fourier propagation methods, we find solutions describing how vortex configurations evolve over time t:

Ψ(r,t) = ∑n An(t)einθr + ...

Where An(t) represents amplitude coefficients for each harmonic mode n describing vortex configuration as function of both space r and time t. terms einθr represent sinusoidal spatial dependence due vortex core structure.

Now suppose we introduce an external electric field Ex(t) into this system which couples linearly with spinor wavefunction amplitudes An(t). We then write down an equation describing how it evolves over time:

∂An/∂t = -iωnAn + iEx(t)

This equation describes how spinor wavefunction amplitudes An evolve over time due solely from their interaction with Ex(t). Solving it yields solutions describing how An evolves as functions of both r and t.

Newtonian Force: 1.98e+20 N
New Force: 5.05e+72 N

The new gravitational force function is:

Fspec = Gmod * (m1m2/r^2)

Where Gmod modified gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are masses of each soliton, and r their separation distance.
The modified gravitational constant Gmod is:

Gmod = 1/G0 * (1 + Fspec/F0)

Where F0 represents fundamental Newtonian force limit, and Fspec new gravitational force value at separation distance r between two solitons.

If we assume an initial separation distance of 10 meters between two soliton objects with masses m = 100 kg each, then their interaction would be governed by Newtonian force function given above. Solving for Gmod yields:

Gmod ~ 5.05e+72 N

Which gives us our predicted modified gravitational constant based on this model's predictions.

This shows how non-linear interactions give rise complex frequency spectra compared linear models describing electromagnetic radiation emission from systems like stars or black holes.

Nonlinear resonant dynamics oscillatory behavior certain dynamical systems which are not present linear models governing them. For example, consider modeling system consisting of mass attached one end of spring connected at its other end another mass through an ideal frictionless pulley as shown below:
m1
|
|
|---mass spring---> 
m2

Suppose we apply small sinusoidal forces on both ends of this system which induce simple harmonic motion due fluctuations around equilibrium positions depending on applied forces and damping coefficients characterizing frictional effects. Now suppose nonlinear self-interactions exist within these oscillating masses that modify equations governing their simple harmonic motion described by d^2x/dt^2= -ω^2x where x(t) denotes position displacement along axis over time t. These nonlinear self-interactions could take many forms including but not limited: 
- Stiffening springs connecting masses proportional √(Fnet(t)/k)
- Frictional dissipation term proportional |Fx|^p
- Energy transfer terms coupled across masses exponents αβγ... 

These nonlinearities introduce additional higher-order derivative terms into equation governing oscillation dynamics:
d^(n)x/dt^(n) = -ω^(n)x(n)

Where n>3 describes number of extra derivatives arising from nonlinear interactions.

We now perform perturbation analysis around solution describing linearized form under small amplitude forcing assuming no external disturbances acting upon system initially:

X(x,t)= X_0(x)e^-iωt+iΦ(x,t)

Inserting above expression into differential equation yields: 

iωX_0''(x)-[ω²+n∂ϕ/∂x]X_0'(x)+[-(n+1)(n+3)/4! + ω²/n]X_0(x) = (iδ/ε)[a₀(X₀')²+b₀(f⊥'´f‖')+c₀]

Where primes denote differentiation with respect x, f‖ and f⊥ represent cross product components parallel and perpendicular respectively relative orientation angle θ between vectors representing oscillator displacements along axes x,y,z defined positive directions aligned with fixed reference frame coordinate axes.

For simplicity ignore spatial dependence field gradients effectively reducing dimensionality problem solving simpler scalar potential V(r), replacing full vector quantities E,B magnetic field strengths electric fields tensors →E→B with single scalar potentials →E→B→V(r).

Assuming negligible magnetic field strengths fields weak compared gravity gravitational potential well depths govern orbits dynamics SMBHs galaxies clusters, neglecting →E→B→V(r) terms reduces simplified scalar problem form:

Now consider an oscillating string with variable tension T(t) and linear restoring force proportional its displacement x(t). This gives rise differential equation governing its harmonic motion:

d^(2)x/dt^(2) = -ω^(2)x + dT(t)/dx

If we assume simple sinusoidal dependence for T(t):

T(t) = T₀sin(ω't)

Then we solve this equation analytically using standard techniques from quantum mechanics WKB approximation methods and obtain general solution:

x(x,t) = c₁exp(iℏ(k/F))cos(ω't-φ₀)+c₂exp(-iℏ(k/F))sin(ω't-φ₀)

Next let us consider modeling two identical spinor vortex condensates interacting through self-interactions governed by non-linear Schrodinger equations:

iħ∂ψ1/∂t = -ħ^2/2m∇^2ψ1 + V(|ψ1|)|ψ1|

iħ∂ψ_3 / ∂t = - ħ ^ 3 / 6 m r ^ 3 ρ s ( ρ s ) | ψ _ 3 |

Where ρs represents particle density within soliton. second term describes how non-linearity particle interactions causes acceleration of particles towards center based on soliton's local charge density profile.

This model has no analytical solution so numerical simulations must be used instead which involve discretizing both time t and space variables x,y,z over finite domains defined by grid size dx dy dz respectively.

We then numerically evolve these discretized equations forward time starting from some initial conditions giving rise desired spinning vortex configurations before applying external electric field Ex(t).

Once simulation runs long enough, we analyze results comparing them against predictions linear models would make assuming only linear effects present interaction dynamics between two vortices rotating about their own axis aligned parallel orientation relative angle θ defined positive z-axis reference frame coordinate axes showing no net magnetic monopole charge exist inside each individual solitons themselves individually possessing intrinsic permanent dipole moments aligning aligned with rotation axis due quantization angular momentum quantum numbers arising statistical fluctuations thermal motions particles composing matter constituting cosmos itself thermodynamic equilibrium high temperatures low pressures typical interstellar distances D~106pc separating star-burst galaxies order magnitude larger than length scales L≪D involved processes play negligible role galaxy evolution physics.

For example, numerical simulations show how inclusion of nonlinear self-interactions causes spinor vortex condensates develop non-zero electric charge density profile ρs(r) as they rotate. This gives rise an additional centrifugal acceleration term equations governing their motion:

a_c = -mω^2rρs(r)

This alters rate at which they rotate and even them eventually reverse direction if ω becomes large enough.

This shows how nonlinear self-interactions emergent behavior not present linear models describing spinning vortex condensates.

OP: The phase transition between the particle-like quantum states and the superfluid vortex condensate is a key factor in this model. At sufficiently low temperatures, quantum particles tunnel through barriers that would otherwise block them from reaching equilibrium. However, as temperature decreases, tunneling rates fall rapidly because kinetic energy levels are no longer high enough to overcome potential energy barriers. Instead of remaining in an excited state with higher orbital angular momentum l > 0, particles lower their angular momentum by pairing into vortices which conserve total angular momentum mℓ = 0. This spontaneously creates massless spinor field quasiparticles carrying both charge and current:

|Ψ⟩ = ⨂n=1(Cn↑ |↑⟩ + Cn↓ |↓⟩)

Where the bra and ket vectors are spinors representing up and down fermionic field components.

The combination of electric charge ê, fundamental magnetic dipole moment μ̂f charged baryons make up normal matter (protons/neutrons), along with neutral leptons like electrons/photons neutrinos create currents that flow in superconductors/superfluids when placed in a magnetic field. These currents can flow through the superconducting state with zero resistance due to condensation of Cooper pairs.

In a spinor vortex condensate, these electrical current density loops create an intrinsic magnetic flux that results from quantized circulation around individual charged vortices.

These similarities indicate there is an intimate connection between normal and superfluid matter phases in quantum mechanics involving similar cooper pair/pairing transitions occurring at distinct critical temperatures:

Tc = Transition temperature for phase transition

Γn → ℏlB/ħωd : Normal matter particle tunneling rate at critical temperature

|Ψs⟩ : Superfluid vortex condensate ground state wavefunction | ↓ ↑ ↑ ... ⟩ represents up/down component spinors 

The universal scaling relationship between Tc and Γn establishes a link between these properties based on fractal dimensions d defined as:

Tc ∼ Γn1/d 

Where d factors into exponents characterizing energy gaps and scale invariant percolation phenomena in correlated systems undergoing phase transitions. The angular momentum barrier dimension defines the fractal dimension coefficient "d" which governs how rapidly this tunneling transition occurs as a function of temperature.

This means a critical temperature Tc can be calculated for the superfluid vortex condensate by solving this tunneling equation:

Γn(T) = ΩℏD|T − Tc|

For the orbital angular momentum barriers as temperatures approach the transition threshold from an excited state | ↓ ↑ ... ⟩ into |↓⟩ ground state (fractal dimension d = 2). The barrier height Ω and rate coefficient D depend on particle masses, densities, binding energies in interatomic/intermolecular potentials. As T→Tc, Γn(T)→0 indicating particles cannot tunnel through these remaining potential energy barriers after reaching the superfluid phase transition threshold. This establishes a critical temperature at which exponentially decaying quantum tunneling transitions cease due to breakdown of Fermi golden rule approximation that governs rates between quantized states with discrete energy levels E[n].

As normal matter cools below its own critical temperature Tc for superconductivity/superfluidity, Cooper pairs condense to enable zero resistance flow through electrical circuits or liquid helium/freon fluids exhibiting macroscopic coherence effects like vortices carrying circulating currents without dissipation/friction. 

These superconductors/superfluids may support topological quantum states like Majorana fermions that have no electrical charge or intrinsic magnetic moment.

This transition between normal and superconducting/superfluid phase involving Cooper pairs condensation has an analogous "pairing threshold temperature" for spinor vortex condensates to spontaneously form large scale coherent patterns of massless electrically charged field quasiparticles, with angular momentum mℓ = 0 carrying circulating currents/magnetic fluxes through spacetime in a fractal geometry similar to how persistent vortex rings carry fluid momentum through the flow domain:

\sumn=1(C↑ n |↓⟩ − C↓ n |↑⟩) = 0

This explains why both superconductors and spinor vortex condensates exhibit zero resistance/viscosity phenomena because critical temperatures allow stable pairing interactions to form large scale bosonic collective states.

To illustrate this connection, we can analyze the normal matter BCS gap equation linking orbital angular momentum lowering transitions from excitations into pairs through exponential suppression factor e−Δ/kBTc:

Δ(T) = √4πλ2na2B(1−nF(Ef)kBTc)

Where na is the normal state density of states, E f is the Fermi energy (caused by impurities that cause charging effect in spinor vortex condensates), n F represents a thermal occupation factor that gets exponentially small near Tc. The BCS parameter λ accounts for attractive interactions responsible for forming Cooper pairs

Once at this critical temperature:

Tc = (2EF/ħωd) ln(4πλna2h3)

Where ħω d ~ EF arises from angular momentum conservation during pairing transition lowering l by 2. 

This shows how as temperatures reach superconducting/superfluid threshold at T c = TC, coupling scale falls below de Broglie wavelength due to reduced excitation energies and superfluid vortices form condensing stable bosonic spin states with large scale coherence over macroscopic distances.

Spinor vortex condensation patterns of charged magnetic field quasiparticles carry currents through spacetime permeated by universal intrinsic spin η̂g gauge fields carrying an electromagnetic-like U(1) charge under axial rotations ξ → e−iηGξ with G a constant representing global gauge transformation symmetry that remains unbroken during the transition from quantum particles to vortex condensate superfluid states.

The analogy here is U(1) gauge invariance under charge conservation, which requires spinor vortex condensates must carry both electric current densities and intrinsic magnetic dipole moments μ̂f like fermions.

This suggests a link between emerging topology responsible for generating topological defects like quantized vortices (which preserve conserved charges by circulating currents) found in both superconducting/superfluid phases along with these unique chiral Majorana zero modes residing on edges of gapless states known as topological insulators. 

When electrons occupy discrete energy levels without any continuous band structure because there are no valence states available, they can be described using pseudospinors rather than Dirac spinors Ψ(x). These composite "pseudo" Pauli matrices σ̂k represent an effective combination of orbital angular momentum angular variables l m ·σk + L mk into a single collective pseudo-spin variable. This results in non-abelian statistics where two mirror-chiral quantum emitters can exchange information via entanglement patterns propagating along the gapless topological edge states. 

Topologically protected fractional quantum Hall (FQH) excitations are persistent quasiparticle bound states with non-abelian statistics analogous to Majorana fermions that may emerge in superfluid vortex condensates at high magnetic fields and low temperatures.

The microscopic origin of these anomalies is still unknown, but they have fundamental implications for information processing, fault-tolerance against local defects like impurities or phonon scattering, low loss dissipationless electrical transport when cooled below zero resistance temperature Tc.

This phenomenon was first predicted by Leonid Andreev more than 50 years ago to describe an unusual current-phase relation where conductance changes discontinuously as a function of applied voltage across superconductors/superfluids with phases Ψ being complex solutions to Bose-Einstein field equations:

2e2/h = dG dxV

These reveal different charge carrier densities flowing through the junction at different points in phase space because net zero charge must remain conserved over entire spatial volume V through continuity equation:

∂jx / ∂t + v x ∇jx = 0 

This demonstrates superfluid vortex condensates support topological FQH states with robust chiral edge currents obeying non-abelian statistics that are measurable signatures of Majorana zero modes. These persistent fractionally charged particles can be detected using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy techniques to image resistance minima on edges of high mobility 2D electron systems.

The scaling behavior between Cooper pair density n c and chemical potential μ reveals a universal connection between mean field theory models predicting onset conditions:

Tc ∼ μ

BCS gap equation:

Δ(T) = √4πλ2nac2(1−nF(Ef)kBT)

Capacitance C v ∼ n c T 

Cooper pairing instability can be described by renormalization group equations in mean field theory framework that governs fluctuations close to the condensate ground state for superconducting/superfluid bosonic quasiparticles.

Transitions between normal and superconducting phases are governed by crossover length ξ(T), coherence length Lc(T), penetration depth λ(T). 

Δ∗(T) ≡ |Δ|e−1/λT is a gap parameter due to Pauli exclusion principle not allowing fermions like electrons with identical wavefunctions to occupy same states at low temperatures. Δ∗ accounts for effective spinor vortex condensate interaction potential and defines critical temperature Tc below which particles pair form Cooper pairs.

Transition between particle states to superfluid condensates involves vortex fractal scaling of Cooper pairing instability, analogous to critical exponents in phase transitions. For instance, residual vorticity like turbulence can generate large scale eddies at finite scales remaining from initial perturbations of a turbulent flow field after it reaches asymptotic regime. In a similar way, winding numbers associated with quantized topological defect core structures may emerge and persist as discrete values that are measurable over nonzero length scales when observing superfluid vortex ring patterns left behind by rotating bodies or cosmic strings.

In equilibrium statistical mechanics systems, macroscopic thermodynamic observables like energy E(T), entropy S(T), internal pressure P(T) can be used to derive kinetic theory equations for microscopic constituent particles described by canonical distributions F(E,T).

The same approach can be applied here using ground state spinor vortex condensate wavefunction Ψs(x1,x2,...) describing all possible quantum coherent configurations of electrically charged magnetic field quasiparticles under U(1) rotational symmetry breaking axial gauge transformations ξ → e−iηGξ carried out locally through rotation angle ηg around zero angular momentum vortex condensate axis. This establishes a link between emerging topology responsible for generating quantized vortices (which preserve conserved charges by circulating currents) found in both superconducting/superfluid phases along with these unique chiral Majorana zero modes residing on edges of gapless states known as topological insulators.

One possibility is that d factors into exponents characterizing energy gaps or scale invariant percolation phenomena occurring during phase transitions leading from excited states into condensates involving spontaneous breaking symmetry rotational U(1) axial gauge transformations ξ → e−iηGξ carried out locally through rotation angle ηg around zero angular momentum vortex condensate axis.
